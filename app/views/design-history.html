      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Card sorting exercise with 6 users to test the groupings and structure of the triage - no use of the prototype</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Version 3</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Focused on creating and testing GOV Forms - created general enquiries form and Share Capital form </li>
          <li>Link to share capital form preview</li>
          <li>Link to general enquiries form preview</li>
          <li>Note that Gov Forms are not versioned and we have since made updates, so the forms will/may have been updated since this round of user testing. You can see the forms in the state they were tested in the mural for this round.</li>
          <li>Created Share Capital outcome pages and included reference numbers for phone number</li>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
         
          <li>First version of triage style site, designed to be in keeping with SmartAnswers style after UX review work. SmartAnswers is a GDS publishing tool and would mean we could build the triage without significant dev resource. Alternatively, we would also be able to develop a service in this style if GDS couldn't or we decided we wanted to.  </li>
          <li>SmartAnswers consists of a start page, question pages, and outcome pages </li>
          <li>First version had 5 categories (registering for a company; filing for a company; closing or restoring a company; penalties, fine or appeals; reporting an issue or making a complaint) on first question page and 'something else'</li>
          
      </ul>

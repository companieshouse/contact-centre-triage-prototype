          <li>First version of triage style site, designed to be in keeping with SmartAnswers style after UX review work. SmartAnswers is a GDS publishing tool and would mean we could build the triage without significant dev resource. Alternatively, we would also be able to develop a service in this style if GDS couldn't or we decided we wanted to.  </li>
          <li>SmartAnswers consists of a start page, question pages, and outcome pages </li>
          <li>First version had 5 categories on first question page and 'something else'</li>
